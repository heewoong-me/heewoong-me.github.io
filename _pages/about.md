I'm a Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, advised by [Taesup Moon](https://mindlab-snu.notion.site/taesup-moon).

My primary research interest lies in developing scalable reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, focusing on (1) improving performance as more data becomes available and (2) enabling generalization over long horizons.

Recently, I have been interested in extending the domain by leveraging offline RL to train large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn settings.
